### Machine Learning / Predictive Modeling

Teams interested in ML may attempt tasks such as:

- Predict **next year’s Max AQI or number of Unhealthy Days** for a county using historical data
- Predict **which counties will experience the highest pollution peaks** (Max AQI or 90th percentile AQI)
- Cluster counties based on historical air quality patterns to identify **high-risk regions**
- Model **pollutant-specific trends** to anticipate which pollutants pose the greatest long-term risk
<br>
<br>

**Additional Datasets Used:**

- [US County Shapefile](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html)

- [SSA to FIPS State and County Crosswalk](https://www.nber.org/research/data/ssa-federal-information-processing-series-fips-state-and-county-crosswalk)
