Machine Learning analysis of air quality

### Machine Learning / Predictive Modeling

Teams interested in ML may attempt tasks such as:

- Predict **next year’s Max AQI or number of Unhealthy Days** for a county using historical data
- Predict **which counties will experience the highest pollution peaks** (Max AQI or 90th percentile AQI)
- Cluster counties based on historical air quality patterns to identify **high-risk regions**
- Model **pollutant-specific trends** to anticipate which pollutants pose the greatest long-term risk
